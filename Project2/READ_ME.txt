##This project finds roots of nonlinear equations using bisection, newton and secant methods.
## Before running the code,please make sure you have following installed in your environment:

### Required Python Packages
*numpy 
*matplotlib


## The project file:
   * main_prjct2.py
   * bisection.py
   * newton.py
   * secant.py
*************************************
## Please run the main python file  *
*************************************
## TROUBLESHOOTING ##
Please run each file individually if there is a problem running the
main file

## Expected Output
 **Terminal Output**: Iterations and roots
 **Plots**:
  * Bisection plots for all 3 functions
  * Newton plots for all 3 functions
  * Secant plots for all 3 functions
